## Problem Statement

### Introduction
This project aims to enhance the SinGAN model [(Shaham et al., ICCV, 2019)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_Generative_Model_From_a_Single_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf) and overcome its limitations, particularly its reliance on a single input image and sensitivity to image quality. We propose to develop a more robust and versatile generative model independent of input image quality.

### Objectives
1. **Enhance Robustness:** Reduce SinGANâ€™s sensitivity to input image quality by developing a model that can effectively generate high-quality outputs even from noisy input images. We plan to implement the following approaches:
    - **Introduction of Losses:**
        - **Perceptual Loss:** Euclidean distance between the feature maps of two images (generated and actual images) extracted from a pretrained image classification network such as VGG or ResNET.
        - **Total Variational Loss:** Measures the total amount of variation in the image, focusing on preserving sharp edges while smoothing out flat areas and reducing noise.
    - **Image Preprocessing:** Implement denoising using the following approaches on the input image before feeding it to the SinGAN network.
        - **Classical Techniques:** Mean and median filter.

### Comparison and Analysis
We will conduct a comparison and extensive analysis of the above modifications on the quality of the generated images.
